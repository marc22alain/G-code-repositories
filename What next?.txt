What next?

What dogfood do you need to prepare?

What programs would be useful to have now?

1. Cutting basic grooves
	-lines
	-curves defined many ways: radius, chord height
	-three radio buttons: cut left/right/center... interface explains whether this means -X, =X, +X, or -Y, =Y, +Y; depends on the axis with most delta

2. Cutting arbitrary outlines
	-straight lines first
	-then include curves

3. Modify programs to make retention tabs	
	-add a check box that modifies the behavior of the last cut

4. Modify programs to do some input checking!
	-sane values
	-numbers not text
	-should happen in the wizard

5. Write program to drill multiple holes, defining a series or pattern of locations

6. Extend Glib.py to include more of the G-codes used by LinuxCNC
